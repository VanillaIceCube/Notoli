# To be honest, I'm still having trouble understanding what the basename does exactly other than "provide clarity"
# Reverse URL Lookups:
#   The basename is used when generating URL patterns for the registered viewset. 
#   It allows you to perform reverse URL lookups with Django's reverse function or the {% url %} template tag.
#   Without specifying a basename, the router might not be able to generate URL names predictably since it falls back to
#   using the queryset's model name for the base or may generate ambiguous names.
