# 📝 Notoli  
**A Notion-Inspired To-Do List App**

Notoli is my personalized take on a to-do list application, inspired by the flexibility of Notion databases.

It’s designed to support **multiple views** of the same list, so my wife, Diana, and I can each use the app in the way that works best for us, whether that’s a clean, simple Notes-style interface or a more detailed, database-like workflow.
