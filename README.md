# 📝 Notoli  
**A Notion-Inspired To-Do List App**

Notoli is my personalized take on a to-do list application, inspired by the flexibility of Notion databases.

It’s designed to support **multiple views** of the same list — so my wife, Diana, can enjoy a clean and simple Notes-style interface, while I can work with something more complex and detailed on my end.
