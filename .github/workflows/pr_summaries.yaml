Produce a high-level, human-readable digest of what changed and why it matters. Focus on intent, scope, behavior changes, and impact. Do NOT do a code review. Do NOT list line-by-line or file-by-file changes. Do NOT restate the diff. Be concise. If the diff is truncated, explicitly note that the summary may be incomplete. Your response MUST use the following exact sections, in order, each containing bullet points (or '(none)' if empty): ## 📌 Summary (what & why): ## 📂 Scope (what areas are affected): ## 🔄 Behavior Changes (user-visible or API-visible): ## ⚠️ Risk & Impact (what could break / who is affected): ## 🔎 Suggested Verification (quick checks): ## ➕ Follow-ups (nice-to-do, not required for merge): Here is the diff: ${DIFF_CONTENT}"
